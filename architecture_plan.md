### Core Technologies Confirmed:

*   **Frontend**: Remix, React, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend**: Go (using Chi for routing, potentially Fiber for performance-critical parts)
*   **Vector Database**: FAISS (for initial development, with an eye towards Pinecone/Chroma for scalability)
*   **Graph Database**: Neo4j
*   **LLM APIs**: Google Gemini Pro, OpenAI GPT, LLAMA 2 (configurable)
*   **File Storage**: Local storage for development, AWS S3 for production
*   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Go backend (expandable to Supabase/Firebase Auth)
*   **Relational DB**: PostgreSQL
*   **Messaging / Email**: SendGrid
*   **Scheduler**: Cron jobs (for automated tasks)
*   **Agent Orchestrator**: Go FSM (for consistency with backend stack)

### Architecture, Data Flows, and Scaling Considerations:

#### High-Level Architecture:

The platform will follow a microservices-oriented architecture, with distinct services for different functionalities (e.g., PDF processing, GraphRAG, Agentic Research, Resume Feedback, Text-to-SQL). This allows for independent scaling and deployment of each component.

#### Data Flows:

1.  **User Interaction**: Frontend (Remix) sends requests to the Go Backend API Gateway.
2.  **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
3.  **Data Processing**: Microservices interact with various databases (PostgreSQL for metadata, FAISS for vector embeddings, Neo4j for knowledge graphs) and external LLM APIs.
4.  **File Handling**: File uploads are handled by a dedicated file service, storing data locally during development and on AWS S3 in production.
5.  **Asynchronous Tasks**: Long-running tasks (e.g., PDF chunking, resume analysis) will be processed asynchronously using Go routines and potentially a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for inter-service communication, triggered by cron jobs or user actions.
6.  **LLM Interaction**: All LLM interactions will go through a centralized LLM service to manage API keys, rate limits, and model selection.

#### Scaling Considerations:

*   **Horizontal Scaling**: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand.
*   **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL can be scaled vertically or horizontally (e.g., read replicas). FAISS can be distributed for large datasets. Neo4j offers clustering for high availability and scalability.
*   **LLM API Management**: Centralized LLM service helps manage API quotas and switch between providers.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Decoupling long-running tasks from synchronous API calls improves responsiveness and scalability.
*   **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data and LLM responses to reduce load on databases and external APIs.
